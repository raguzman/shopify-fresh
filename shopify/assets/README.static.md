## Static files

All files inside this directory are ignored by git except for files with static in their filename. Since this directory is also shared with the files generated by webpack, it's cleaned on every consecutive build except for static files.

Add the `static` keyword to the filename of any file you place manually in this directory.

IE:

```
my-file.static.jpg
open-sans-regular.static.ttf
open-sans-regular.static.woff
open-sans-regular.static.woff2
```
